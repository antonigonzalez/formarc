          <h2>Who am I?</h2>
         <p>

           As you can see in the header my name is Tony Gonzalez and (apart from being a husband, a father and a son) I am an IT professional who has worked in IT support for more than 10 years. <br>
           I have worked as an online support analyst or platform manager mostly, though at the beginning of my career I wrote code too. <br>
           During my last 4 years (until the end of April 2020) I was officially a busines system analyst for the Oxford University Press but in reality, I was the platform manager of a customer-facing platform (Oxford Learnerâ€™s bookshelf). <br>
           What was I doing during those 4 years? <br>
           Mostly I was supervising the day-to-day running of the platform. That meant lots of things, for instance:
         </p>

           <ol class = "my_list">
             <li style="list-style-type: disc">Fixing issues and adding changes to the platform via software releases.</li><br>
             <li style="list-style-type: disc">Coordinating the work of our testers, developers and second line support.</li><br>
             <li style="list-style-type: disc">Making sure that changes in the platform and other related platforms did what they were supposed to do without affecting negatively our platform. </li>
          </ol>
          <br>
         <p>
           My main skill: communication.<br>
           There was a British Prime Minister whose motto was: Education, Education, Education. Well, mine is: <br>
           Communication, communication, communication.<br>
           Why do I have this website? <br>
           To prove that I know about Cloud Computing. I am an AWS Certified Solutions Architect, and I am going to use this website as proof that apart from the theory I can do the practice too!<br>
           So, check the <a class="internal_links" href="architecture.html">Architecture</a> of this site and <a class="internal_links" href="feedback.html">get in touch</a> with me.
